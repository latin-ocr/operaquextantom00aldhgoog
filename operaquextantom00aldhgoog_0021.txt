and in the case of Aldhelm, the difficulties which attend
an inquiry into the incidents os his youthful days and his
residence at Malmesbury are as follows. He is by general
consent allowed to have died in A.D. 709, aster he had
held the Bishopric of Salisbury four years. william of

639, or earlier. But as Hadrian his reputed preceptor came
to England in 670 or 671, [Bede’s E. H. iv. l.] Aldhelm
must have been at least thirty years old when he first
became his pupil.

that Aldhelm had passed some time in the Monastery of
Malmesbury under Maildulf, before he went into Kent to
receive the instructions of Adrian: this will agree very well
with the fact above mentioned, but apparently not with
