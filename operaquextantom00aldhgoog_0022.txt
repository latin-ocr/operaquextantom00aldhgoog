the uncultured state ol his mind tban to his juvenile years,
and that his biographers have taken his words too literally.

Great obscurity also hange over every part of Aldhelm's
residence at llalmesbury: but tbis perhaps is less to be
wondered at, sor we still know more of his life than we do
of many great men who have lived within two hundred
years os our own times. The monuments of human genius
bear a certain impress of eternity‚ and the most imperish·
able are the productions of the pen, which will outlive the
Pyrumids of Egypt, and have already outlived the farne of
their founders.

We are informed by the legend of Capgrave, [p. aad]
that Aldhelm was made Abbot of Malmesbury thirty-four
years before his death. This must therefore have been in
the year 6⁷5: and this hmmonizes sufficiently with the
statement of his having gone to study in Kent four or five
years before. From the extract quoted in page 339, it
would appear that he became a monh after his return from
Kent. But we are told immediately afterwards, that
Maildulf lived fourteen years aster Aldhelm's tonsure. It
is however probable that the fourteen years must be
rechoned from the time of his first entering the Monastery
as a pupil, and that Aldhelm did not assume the tonsure
till his retum from Kent, and as he became Abbot in 675,
this may be reasonably considered as the date of Maildult's
death. This view of the matter harmonizes to acertain
extent with the Charters in peges ato-att. The first two
os these are duplicates one of the other. The latter is
apparentlyafictitious copy of the former. Aldhelm is styled
Presbyter in both; and the date of the former would
correspond with this title: but in the year 680, which is
the date of the latter, he certainly was no longer Priest but
Abbot. But for the various dates which occur in the
