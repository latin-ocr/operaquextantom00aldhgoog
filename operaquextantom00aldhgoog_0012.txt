they are now much augmented by the collation of seven
MSS· preserved in the King's Library at Paris, [etto
7640, &e See Catalogue]

The poems De Basilica 850. and De Aris, are published
among the Worhs of Rhabanus Maums and Alcuin:
but Mai restores the former to Aldhelm in his Classici
Auctores, Vol. Va ou the authority of a MS. in the vatican,
adding a note that the other also belongs to Aldhelm.
This opinion is confirmed by the authority of MS. sals,
[Bih. Reg. Paris] which also contains another fragment
now first published‚ but all these three pisces are from one
continuous poem in the Ms. without division or separate
heading, and the first part of the poem De Aris, com-
mencing with the words Hanc aulam Domini, precedes
the poem De Basilica· The concluding six lines Hor ,
precibus mira ἓςο. are divided from the rest by a space3
after which come the words Expliciuat opuscula Aldhelmi.
The volume is made up ol leaves out ol different books,
and only about six leaves of the collection ol Aldhelm’s
Opuscula remain.

The other letters of Aldhelm‚ together with some ad·
dressed to him by other persons, are taken from the col-
lation of Boniface’s letters published at Mayence, and
from Malmesbury's life ol Aldhelm.

In the Library ol Trinity college, Cambridge, is another
worh ascribed in the Catalogue to Aldhelm. Itis along
poem containing several thousand lines, entitled De Pea-
tateucho. The MS. is oue of the tenth century, but the
work which it contains is the same os which a portion
under the title os Genesis Carmen has been ascribed to
Tertullian and Cyprias, and is found in all the editions
of the latter. The Editor was enabled to ascertain this
lact hythe hindness os the Master of Trinity, who confided
the MS. to his caru, whorchy a ruore minute examination
