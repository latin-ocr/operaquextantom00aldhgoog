history of Aldhelm's lise, we refer the render to the Chro-
nological Table ermexed to this memoir. Let us bricfly
relate what befel him in tho latter portion ot' his lise. He
visited Rome at the invitationes Pope Sergius, during
the time thet he was still Abbot, but of the incidente οἱ
this visit no records heve been preserved, save e few mi-
raculous legends, and a short poem, which he is said to
have written on entering the Church of St Peter and
Sc Paul. This composition, though probably not written
at Rome, is not unpleesing, and is in the original Latin at
least equal to the following translation of it in English.

VERSES ·
On enteriop tlte Choreb of St. Peter aod St. Paul ot Rome.

See how this new-built temple’s glories riso,

And list its sacred banner to the skiest

Here Paul and Peter rhed obroatl their light,

To guide a world where all before was uightz

To them this land, to them these courts belong:
Their names the people chsunt in hallowed song.
Hril, hesyeuly Portet, keeper of Hoeven’s gete,
And hear the prayers of those who in thy temple weit,
Whilst down their cheek rioth run the briny tear,
Do thou their supplicatione kindly hesr.

With ardent vows they moum the mispent pust,
And vow that such misdeeds shall be their last.

And thou, great toacher, deign to hear me, Paul,
Thou who ‹litlst bear the former nome of Saul:
Ami spum Christ's worship for each hecthen rite,
Till on thy oyes lle poured His glorious light.

Ohl kindly hear the rows to thee they pay,

And lend thy haud to guido the supplient’s way:
Here to thy Church what numerous votarics throng,
'lb thee the heys oi Hersen end Hell belong.
Forth let the springs ol Hoevenly bonuty flow,

'l'o cheer Christ's faithful worshippers below.
