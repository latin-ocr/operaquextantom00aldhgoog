Tne Worlrs of aldhelm, first Bishop of Salisbury, have

never before been collected together. They are now sor
the first time published uniformly t‘rom manuscripts and
existing editions. The following notice will suffice to

The prose treatisc De uirginitate coactorum aive de
Laude turpinitatis, published by Canisius and repeated
in the Bibliotheca Petrum, was a third time edited by
Whurton from a MS. in the Lambetb Library‚ at the end

the preceding, yet abounds in errors, and at least a

MS. in Caius Collega Library, Cambridge, lor an oppor-

J . Smith, Mat. one ο1 the Fellows of that Society.

The Epistola ad Eoly‘ridum was published by Usher
in his Sylloge Epistolarum Hibernicarum, the text ο1
which edition has now been compared with a very ancient
MS. in the British Museum, Reg. 7. DXXIV.

The trectise De Mettica, was printed, without the
AEniyrnara hy Mai, in the fifth volume of his Classici
Auctores, Svo. the textos which has been now collated
with a very ancient MS. preserved in the King’s Library
at Paris [2339] which contains the AEariqmata.

The AEniqmatn, the poem De laudibus virginum, De
octo principaliter vitiis, were first published by Delrio
at Mayance, and reprinted in the Bibliotheca Petrum:
