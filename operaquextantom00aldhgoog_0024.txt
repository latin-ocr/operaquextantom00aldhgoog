Mona important era opens
Ι to us with the assembling of a
· , ¹ ἒ Synod to counteract the prac-

a κ ξ ’ be lamented that os this Synod,
’ not even the date has been re-

  
 

corded. All that we know of
, its proceedingsiS,thatAldhelm
was commissioned to write to the schismaticS,and if possible
convert them. The Letter or Treatise which he addressed
to their king Geruntius may be seen in its place in this
volume.

We are also informed by his biographers of another
pleasing incident'in his life whilst he was Abbot. He had
remarked with pain the neglect which the common people
evinced towards the ceremonies of religion, and in order
to counteract it, stationed himself on the bridge over which
the people passed, and sang certain songs in the vernaculas
tongue which he had composed for the occasion. By
these gentle and popular means he produced an effect far
more power-ful than would have attended more grave and
severe admonitions.

In the year 705, a greater honour awaited Aldhelm than
that of being made the representative os a national council.

ΤΙιθ venerable Hedda, who for twenty-nine years had
governed the diocese of Wessex, was now removed by
death from the scene of his earthly labourS. His diocese,
says William os Malmesbury‚ was very extensive, compre-
hending as much territory as belongs to four dioceses in
my time. It was therefore a salutar-y measure of King
Ina to divide this weight of duty3 and to this determina-
tion we owe the origin os the present Bishopric of Salisbury.
The venerable Daniel was placed over the ancient diocese
