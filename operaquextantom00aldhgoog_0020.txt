bury, that “ by the company
and example of the MonkS‚ Aldbelm acquired an ex·
tensive knowledge of science and the liberal artS, and that
in order to implent these more thoroughly in his mind,
he again went to Kent‚ and studied at the feet of Adrian
the fountain of learning, and the source of all the arts:
but he returned home again, in consequence of ill health.
To have enjoyed the society of such a teacher could not
fail to render him master of all polite learning.” But we
have his own testimony in favour of his acquirements, for
he says, that he was the first man of his own nation, who
directed his mind to the knowledge of the science of mette.
For these are his words, found at the end of the book which
he wrote on Figures of Speech. “ Thus much heve Ι
written concerning the different kinds os metre and the
figures of speech, as far as my humble ebility would enable
me: it has been a work of much labour, and I know not
whether profitable or not, although 1 am conscious to
myself that I can apply to myself that boast of Virgil,

 

First of my rece (if life inspire these veina)
